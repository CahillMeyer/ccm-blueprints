# Tree View Customization

**Summary:** Enhanced tree view with C++ custom components, naming, and color coding

## Overview
I added flexible naming options and color‑coded routes to the tree view. Since the existing components lacked color support, I extended the C++ Embarcadero components with new events and members so the app can control colors from the UI. Planners can quickly distinguish routes when managing large schedules.
