# Star Plot

**Summary:** Star Plot map view shows route clustering and efficiency

## Overview
I added a Star Plot Map View to a logistics planner. Standard maps showed only individual trips; the new view displays all trips together to reveal clustering and route tightness. Integrated with OSRM distances and interactive selection between grid and map so planners can spot inefficiencies faster.
