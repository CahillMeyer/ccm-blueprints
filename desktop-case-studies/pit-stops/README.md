# Pit Stops

**Summary:** Added pit stop feature with time windows and map point integration

## Overview
I added Pit Stops—non‑delivery stops like fuel, rest, or border checks. Unlike older non‑delivery logic, pit stops support delivery windows, distance and time tracking, and can be slotted between stops or as return alternatives. Each pit stop links to a map point so it behaves like a normal customer stop.
