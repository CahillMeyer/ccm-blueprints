# Snap To Coordinate Radius

**Summary:** Improved routing with editable snap points, radius, and OSRM options.

## Overview
I added visibility and edit controls for snap‑to‑coordinates so users could move, update, or delete snap points. Later I introduced a radius option so OSRM finds valid nearby connections automatically, reducing errors from one‑way roads and incomplete OSM data. Also enabled custom OSRM directories (local or shared memory on servers) for flexible deployment.
