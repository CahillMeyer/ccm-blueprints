# Section Compartment

**Summary:** Added site/map restrictions and visibility for vehicle compartments

## Overview
I added section and compartment restrictions to support rolltainers and multi‑compartment vehicles. Restrictions can be applied at section or compartment level by site or map point. Clicking a compartment highlights stops it supplies; detail views show which compartment a load belongs to at loading. Improves control and visibility for planners.
